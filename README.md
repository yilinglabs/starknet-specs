# StarkNet Protocol Specifications

Welcome to the official repository for the StarkNet Protocol Specifications. This repository is dedicated to refining and abstracting the protocols involved in various processes within the StarkNet ecosystem. Our goal is to provide clear and detailed documentation of StarkNet's protocols by extensively studying and analyzing popular implementations within the StarkNet community.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this repository is to:
- **Research and Analyze**: Conduct in-depth studies on various implementations within the StarkNet ecosystem.
- **Document and Abstract**: Extract and document the protocol specifications from these implementations.

## Current Focus

We are currently in the research phase, focusing on various popular implementations in the StarkNet ecosystem, including but not limited to:
- **Sequencer Implementations**: Madara and Kraken
- **Full Node Implementations**: Pathfinder, Papyrus, Juno
- **Execution Engine**: Blockifier
- **Virtual Machines**: Cairo VM and Cairo Native

## Upcoming

In the near future, we plan to:
- Publish the research findings from the aforementioned projects.
- Release refined protocol specifications based on our analysis.
- Continuously update the repository with the latest advancements and updates in the StarkNet protocols.
